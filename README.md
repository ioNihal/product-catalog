### Journey from Information to Working Application 

# Planning:

When it comes to planning, sometimes you might have confusion in where to start. So I just prompted  CHAT GPT to plan a project structure and development flow. By referring the answer I got a full idea on the project development flow. 

# Coding :

After setting up a working model, i got some error when passing props (everytime it was the product.json) it took some hours to finally able get rid of every errors and make a better working model. Yeah I used some help from ChatGPT

# Designing :

I had no idea how does a SAP catalog page is designed, so i started referring so many designs on google. But it was all like multi page and all i have to do was add a product list and car and two components ( search and filter), so managing the empty space wqs hard. So finally i made a basic boxy and flex centered design. 

Then i asked my friends what color they would like to see here, they gave me some and finally i thought luxury palette might be good looking. 

I used [ColorHunt](https://colorhunt.co) to find a good color palette. 
And for fonts i used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) for some best matching font, yeah definitely luxury ones
