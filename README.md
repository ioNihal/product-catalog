### Journey from Information to Working Application 

##### Planning:

When it comes to planning, sometimes you might have confusion in where to start. So I just prompted  CHAT GPT to plan a project structure and development flow. By referring the answer I got a full idea on the project development flow. 

##### Coding :

After setting up a working model, i got some error when passing props (everytime it was the product.json) it took some hours to finally able get rid of every errors and make a better working model. Yeah I used some help from ChatGPT

##### Designing :

I had no idea how does a SAP catalog page is designed, so i started referring so many designs on google. But it was all like multi page and all i have to do was add a product list and car and two components ( search and filter), so managing the empty space wqs hard. So finally i made a basic boxy and flex centered design. 

Then i asked my friends what color they would like to see here, they gave me some and finally i thought luxury palette might be good looking. 

I used [ColorHunt](https://colorhunt.co) to find a good color palette. 
And for fonts i used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) for some best matching font, yeah definitely luxury ones

Finally i made a design which is not very responsive! 

##### Making Responsive :

When you have a good design and to make it responsive very easily, then you can just ask ChatGPT to do it (requires great prompting skills) then we can do our on adjustments in it. 

###### Note - i didn't want to use Bootstrap or Tailwind because i want to master CSS better, and  i prompted ChatGPT to create the loading page to make the development faster. 

##### Testing :

Then i test the page in different devices and screen, like my phone, my siblings phone, tablet, laptop and my own monitor. Also i tested out the free size also

#### Additional Info :

[Raw Pixels](https://www.rawpixel.com/) - used for free high quality PNG's. 
[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - used for compressing and optimizing PNG

I have also tried to use the new HTML Popover API for filterbox popup. But as it just released few days ago, msstering its css position was challenging
